They do you\nwrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men\nin your ward sufficient\nHis name is Romeo, and a Montague;\nThe only son of your great enemy.\n\nJULIET:\nMy only love sprung from my only hate!\nToo early seen unknown, and known too late!\nProdigious birth of love it is to me,\nThat I must love a loathed enemy.\n\nNurse:\nWhat's this? what's this?\n\nJULIET:\nA rhyme I learn'd even now\nOf one I danced withal.\n\nNurse:\nAnon, anon!\nCome, let's away; the strangers all are gone.\n\nChorus:\nNow old desire doth in his death-bed lie,\nAnd young affection gapes to be his heir;\nThat fair for which love groan'd for and would die,\nWith tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.\nNow Romeo is beloved and loves again,\nAlike betwitched by the charm of looks,\nBut to his foe supposed he must complain,\nAnd she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:\nBeing held a foe, he may not have access\nTo breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;\nAnd she as much in love, her means much less\nTo meet her new-beloved any where:\nBut passion lends them power, time means, to meet\nTempering extremities with extreme sweet.\n\nROMEO:\nCan I go forward when my heart is here?\nTurn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nRomeo! my cousin Romeo!\n\nMERCUTIO:\nHe is wise;\nAnd, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nHe ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:\nCall, good Mercutio.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nNay, I'll conjure too.\nRomeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!\nAppear thou in the likeness of a sigh:\nSpeak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;\nCry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'\nSpeak to my gossip Venus one fair word,\nOne nick-name for her purblind son and heir,\nYoung Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,\nWheny that Richmond should be king,\nWhen Richmond was a little peevish boy.\nA king, perhaps, perhaps,--\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nMy lord!\n\nKING RICHARD III:\nHow chance the prophet could not at that time\nHave told me, I being by, that I should kill him?\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nMy lord, your promise for the earldom,--\n\nKING RICHARD III:\nRichmond!

## Train the model

Now we can go about training the model! First, we need to extract the Axon model and parameters from the Bumblebee model map:

```elixir
%{model: model, params: params} = model

model
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
#Axon<
  inputs: %{"attention_head_mask" => {12, 12}, "attention_mask" => {nil, nil}, "cache" => nil, "input_embeddings" => {nil, nil, 768}, "input_ids" => {nil, nil}, "position_ids" => {nil, nil}}
  outputs: "container_37"
  nodes: 859
>
```

The Axon model actually outputs a map with `:logits`, `:hidden_states`, and `:attentions`. You can see this by using `Axon.get_output_shape/2` with an input. This method symbolically executes the graph and gets the resulting shapes:

```elixir
[{input, _}] = Enum.take(train_batch_stream, 1)
Axon.get_output_shape(model, input)
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
%{
  cache: #Axon.None<...>,
  logits: {4, 512, 50257},
  cross_attentions: #Axon.None<...>,
  hidden_states: #Axon.None<...>,
  attentions: #Axon.None<...>
}
```

For training LoRA adapters, we'll freeze the original layers, and append adapters to our target nodes

```elixir
lora_model =
  model
  |> Axon.freeze()
  |> Lorax.foo(
    %Lorax.Config{r: r, lora_alpha: lora_alpha, lora_dropout: lora_dropout},
    fn %Axon.Node{name: name_fn, op: _op} ->
      # https://github.com/elixir-nx/axon/blob/v0.6.0/lib/axon.ex#L3923
      # names are generated lazily, and look like "decoder.blocks.11.self_attention.value"
      # have to invoke the function to see what layer the node represents
      name = name_fn.(nil, nil)
      shortname = String.split(name, ".") |> List.last()

      if shortname == "key" or shortname == "query" or shortname == "value" do
        true
      else
        false
      end
    end
  )
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
#Axon<
  inputs: %{"attention_head_mask" => {12, 12}, "attention_mask" => {nil, nil}, "cache" => nil, "input_embeddings" => {nil, nil, 768}, "input_ids" => {nil, nil}, "position_ids" => {nil, nil}}
  outputs: "container_37"
  nodes: 895
>
```

Now we can declare our training loop. You can construct Axon training loops using the `Axon.Loop.trainer/3` factory method with a model, loss function, and optimizer. We'll also adjust the log-settings to more frequently log metrics to standard out:

```elixir
defmodule CommonTrain do
  import Nx.Defn

  defn custom_predict_fn(model_predict_fn, params, input) do
    %{prediction: preds} = out = model_predict_fn.(params, input)

    # Output of GPT2 model is a map containing logits and other tensors
    logits = preds.logits

    {b, t, c} = Nx.shape(logits)
    reshaped = Nx.reshape(logits, {b * t, c})
    %{out | prediction: reshaped}
  end

  def custom_loss_fn(y_true, y_pred) do
    Axon.Losses.categorical_cross_entropy(y_true, y_pred,
      from_logits: true,
      sparse: true,
      reduction: :mean
    )
  end
end

{init_fn, predict_fn} = Axon.build(lora_model, mode: :train)
custom_predict_fn = &CommonTrain.custom_predict_fn(predict_fn, &1, &2)
custom_loss_fn = &CommonTrain.custom_loss_fn(&1, &2)

lora_params =
  {init_fn, custom_predict_fn}
  |> Axon.Loop.trainer(custom_loss_fn, Polaris.Optimizers.adam(learning_rate: 3.0e-4))
  |> Axon.Loop.run(train_batch_stream, params, epochs: 1, iterations: 1000, compiler: EXLA)
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->
